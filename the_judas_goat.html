<p id="dropcap">A<span id="space">_</span>pure carmine, an emerald green, a deep turquoise, a sunflower-petal yellow, an almost-violet white… The flames of the procession’s torches burned in every hue Kirioth had ever seen–and some he was sure he hadn’t. Somehow, despite there being three hundred of them, every one seemed utterly unique. There was an old tale of a woman who had treated her lover’s torch with copper so that, when she saw the marcher with a green flame in the night, she could blow her one last kiss. The story went that the next year the whole town followed suit, with all trying to find a way to produce a colour no one else would. He did not know if it was a true story–it certainly wasn’t part of the scriptural canon–but its romance had cemented it as the raison d&#39;être for the tradition. Against the inky darkness of the night, the flames made the procession of the chosen seem as if it were a giant rainbow-scaled serpent slithering towards him through the curved cobblestone streets of the town below. It was a sight Kirioth treasured on the eve of each ascent ever since his father had first shown him the view from up here on the bell tower all those years ago. He pitied that the chosen themselves never got to witness it. It occurred to him, then, that it was now a privilege he shared only with the Gods. He listened to the chosen's farewell song as they marched closer. They were a choir with every register, he thought. As beautiful as the procession was, it approached the gates now; he must go down and lead it beyond. He pulled the rope to ring the bell loudly. By the time he had descended, he knew, the gates would be open, with the chosen assembled before it.</p>

<p>Tonight, the streets were empty save for the chosen. A quiet salute of prayer through the window as the procession passed each house would be the final sight of their families until they were one day reunited in the Godsrealm. He studied the faces in the crowd, which lit as they were in so many different colours at once, appeared almost as if they were bathed in sunlight. The Gods never revealed why anyone was chosen when they were, but he knew they had their reasons. Everyone was chosen eventually, of course. Some day, when he had raised and trained his successor, he would be among them, just as his father had been seven years prior. Most of this year’s chosen were men and women he knew well, parents of children who had reached adulthood. It was rare to become a grandparent before one was chosen, but there were a few of those here as well–among them the town’s head librarian, a teacher, and a fellow priest. Every year, too, there were some younger faces in the crowd. This year was no exception. He spotted a girl whose torch was almost as tall as she was. Its flame was cerulean, a hue which felt familiar to him, though though he couldn’t remember why. He smiled at her, then turned to address the whole crowd. “You have sung your farewell song,” he announced, “now it is time you meet those who once sang it to you”.</p>

<p>As they passed beyond the town’s gate, the great mountain came into view. Blacker even than the night sky, it pierced the heavens like an obsidian arrowhead. It seemed impossibly steep to climb from its base, somehow taller than it was wide. Indeed, he knew no one <em>could</em> climb it without knowledge of its secret path: a spiral of tracks, narrow bridges, and steps, all carved into the rock itself and barely perceptible beneath the year-round cover of snow. Certainly, no one would be able to climb it to visit their ancestors in the Godsrealm before their time, try as they might. As the mountain guide, Kirioth was the only one in <em>this</em> realm who knew the path. He had been bestowed with the sacred duty to lead the chosen to its summit each summer solstice, just as it had been his father’s duty and the duty of his father before him, going back to the day the Gods had taught it to his family.</p>

<p>The trek was arduous, but if one knew the way as he did, it was not half as treacherous as it would otherwise appear. Nevertheless, he insisted that all three hundred of them were tied together by a long, thick rope threaded through a steel ring at the side of each of their belts. He had led seven ascents and never lost anyone to the mountain; he intended to keep it that way. If one of the Gods’ chosen didn’t reach the top, they would not be able to enter the Godsrealm, and their soul would be trapped with their body on the mountain forever. That was not something he wanted weighing on his conscience. They climbed in single file, with Kirioth leading from the very front. He led them in song, too, with hymns to set the rhythm of their hike. The path, he knew, was not the only secret to scaling the mountain–pacing was just as important. The chosen had trained for this, and by the Gods’ wise decree, they had partaken in the traditional month of feasts before the climb, but he could not afford for even a single climber to succumb to exhaustion before they had reached their destination.</p>

<p>As soon as the day broke, they abandoned their heavy torches. The purpose of embarking on the night of the solstice was to ensure the whole ascent could be made during daylight, for the winds near the summit could extinguish any torch, and the mountainside was no place for a camp of three hundred. In the day, they could finally take in the view of the landscape below–a view the chosen would never have seen before. With each loop around the mountain’s spiral path, the town below seemed to shrink by half. He was gazing down at the bell tower, which now appeared the size of a long grain of rice held at arm’s length, when he felt a pull on the rope and a distant scream sound out somewhere in the line behind him. He snapped around, eyes darting, but it was too far back around the curved steps for him to see where the scream had come from. He removed his belt and began climbing rapidly down the steps, always with one hand firmly gripping the rope. He caught panicked words from the climbers as he passed them. He heard crying, unmistakably the sobs of a child. About a hundred climbers down in the line, he spotted the young girl he’d seen the night before. She was sitting awkwardly, clutching her foot, with tears streaming down her reddened cheeks. “She slipped, Kirioth,” said the man who stood immediately behind her in a shaky tone, “the rope saved her from falling, but she can’t stand up–I think her ankle is broken”. Worried murmurs spread up and down the line as if the rope itself carried fear like the vibrations on a spider’s web. He stepped down further and knelt beside the girl to inspect her ankle. The man’s suspicion was correct. “Oh dear… shhhh shshsh,” he said comfortingly, gently stroking the girl’s hair. He paused for a long moment, feeling the eyes on him. “Well”, he announced suddenly in the priestly boom he had acquired from his father, startling the girl so much she stopped crying, “there is only one thing for it”. In a swift movement, he disconnected the girls belt and lifted her up. All stared at him, some whispering, some with their mouths agape. “Have you ever ridden a horse?” he asked the girl. She shook her head, blinking. “Well, today’s your lucky day”, he said, “but you’ll need to hold on tight because I don’t have a saddle”. She giggled, still sniffling, as he hoisted her into position, holding her legs whilst she put her arms around his neck. Much slower than before, he began walking back up to the front of the line. “I wasn’t going to just <em>throw her off</em>!” he yelled in a playful tone, “The Gods <em>chose</em> her! I’d sooner throw myself off than deny them”. Now, it was laughter that carried up and down the rope, though he knew that, for some, the reassurance was not merely in jest.</p>

<p>It took a full day of climbing–perhaps the slowest he had ever led, carrying the girl on his back, light as she was–but by sunset, they had passed above the clouds that clung to the mountain just below its peak. He knew this meant they were close to the summit, and before long, he saw the temple. He was glad they had reached when they did; the stone always appeared strikingly golden in the light of this hour. He was about to open his mouth when the girl exclaimed, “It’s there!”. Her observation was repeated down the line in increasingly excited tones until it gave way to a chorus of euphoric cheers. His most fiery sermons rarely received half this much exaltation, he mused to himself. The temple was circular, topped by a colossal domed roof supported by twelve enormous fluted columns, but otherwise open to the sky. Inside, the temple sloped downwards in the fashion of an amphitheatre, with many terraced levels of seating connected by a set of stairs on either side. On the far side, where the stage would normally be, was a great stone set of doors–sized for the Gods, he thought. At the centre was a magnificent fountain of wine, sparkling in the sunset light, which made a pleasant sound as the ruby-red liquid shot out of its many ornate spouts. Kirioth heard gasps as they descended towards it. “My chosen brothers and sisters, this is the wine of the Gods, and I can personally attest that it tastes as such. A fitting reward for your long climb, I should think. I know you must be thirsty. You will see that there are cups around the fountain, fill them.” They all excitedly obeyed. He raised his cup and toasted, “To reunion!”. “To reunion!” they repeated, and drank. He swirled his cup and let the sweet scent of the wine fill his nose, but he did not bring it to his lips. It always reminded him of the poppies outside the village. “Why don’t you drink too, Kirioth?” asked the girl, who he had set down in front of the fountain. He laughed and replied “<em>I</em> have to climb back <em>down</em> on the morrow, remember?”. The girl giggled, and sipped, then frowned. “When will I see you again? And mama? And everyone at school?” she asked in a worried tone. “Think not of those you will wait for; think of those who have been waiting for you–like your papa! You’ll see him again today”, he said. She smiled again, and he gently helped tilt her cup higher and higher until she had finished.</p>

<p>In what seemed like an instant, the golden light turned blue. As if on cue, the atmosphere in the temple drifted from jovial to drowsy. Within a few minutes, everyone was reclined on the many terraced levels before the fountain. The girl lay with her head resting on his lap. He began to sing again–this time a lullaby in the old tongue his father had used to sing to him. Kirioth remembered singing it back to him eight years ago when, after that final ascent, his father laid where the girl lay now. He had continued ever since. Before long, everyone’s eyes were closed. He felt the soft rise and fall of the girl’s chest slow and then stop. The extraordinary taste of the Gods’ wine, he thought, was matched only by its potency. He stood up, carefully resting the girl’s head. One by one, he inspected each of the three hundred chosen to ensure that they, too, had all fallen into wine sleep. Only then did he taste the wine himself—just a sip.</p>

<p>He awoke to sunrise. The temple was empty save for him. The Gods, he knew, had taken the chosen through those doors and into their realm as he slept. Just as he had learned to expect, they had also left a thin clay tablet for him. It contained the names of those the Gods had chosen for the next solstice. Three hundred fifty names, all told. He saw a note, too, at the bottom. “Well done saving the girl, Kirioth”, it read. It was unsigned. “Father?” he said out loud, involuntarily. It was then he remembered that his father’s flame had been cerulean. Somehow, that insignificant fact caused a well of suppressed emotion to rise within him. It felt as if there was an unspeakable enormity to this moment, a truth lying just beneath the surface of his mind, and if he kept staring at this tablet, it would break the surface. Choking back tears, he quickly stuffed the tablet into his rucksack and walked briskly up the stairs to the temple entrance. Just as he reached it, he turned to take one last look at the great doors, feeling the quite insane urge to go and open them. He laughed, despite himself, shook his head, and stepped outside the temple. Those doors could not be opened by him even if he tried, he knew. He began to descend the mountain much faster than he had ascended it. After all, food waited at the bottom of the mountain, and he would kill for a meal right now. Serving the Gods was hungry work.</p>
