    <h1>Fly Me To The Moon</h1>

    <p>
        Below is an interactive simulation which allows you to pilot a rocket ship to the Moon.
    </p>

    <p>
        This simulation is, of course, greatly simplified, in many respects–for example:
    <ul>
        <li>It is purely 2-dimensional.</li>
        <li>It is wildly not-to-scale (the moon is actually much further away and much smaller).</li>
        <li>The rocket itself has infinite fuel.</li>
        <li>The Earth and Moon are both completely stationary.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Nevertheless, I promise that it is physically realistic in the key respects that make it so the basic principles
        of piloting this simulated rocketship to the moon are identical to piloting a real one.

        These simplifications are so that those basic principles will be all that you need to successfully land on the
        moon.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, give it a go. Press up to fire the rocket and use the left and right arrow keys to set your heading (the
        direction the nose of the rocketship is pointing).
    </p>

    <p>Ouch! You crashed. Well, don't feel bad–what I didn't mention is that even in this simplified simulation, its not
        quite as simple as just pointing the ship in the direction of the moon and firing the rocket.

        You can have another go first, if you like, but the rest of this essay will show you the secrets of spaceflight.
        By the end, you'll be able to fly to the moon with your eyes closed—without crashing.

        I won't say it ain't rocket science cause, well, it is. But it's probably much easier than you'd expect from
        this first time trying.
    </p>

    <p>Well... you did certainly *reach* the Moon, at least! Maybe not in one piece, but still, that's gotta count for
        something right? In any case, you have now learned that safely *landing* on the moon is not quite as easy as
        getting there. Feel free to have another go first if you like, but if you want to learn the secrets of
        (survivable) spaceflight, read on.</p>

    <p>Woah, well done! Either you're really smart, really lucky, or you've done this before. Regardless, read on to
        learn the secrets of your successful landing so that you can replicate it with ease-and perhaps even venture
        much further afield.</p>


    <h2>Falling in Style</h2>

    <p>I'll admit, flying to the moon is maybe a slightly ambitious goal to begin with. Lets start with a more immediate
        problem: not crashing after launch.</p>

    <p>Getting up into the sky is easy, but to paraphrase Sir Isaac Newton, 'what goes up must come down'. You might
        think we just need to get far enough away from the earth that we no longer feel its gravity. However, although
        that is possible*, its not going to work for getting to the moon.</p>

    <p>If you stand on top of a tall tower and you drop one metal ball off the edge at the same time as firing another
        one from a cannon, then all other things being equal, they would hit the water at the same time, although
        obviously the cannonball would have travelled a significant horizontal distance. This is because they *fall* at
        the same rate. However, the direction of 'down' is not constant. If you travel far enough on a curved planet,
        then the
        direction of down will change considerably. If you walk halfway around the planet, then the direction of down
        will be perpendicular to the direction of down where you started!</p>

    <p>To help you out, we're going to add a projection of your trajectory so you can see how it changes live.</p>


    <p>We therefore see that there is nothing fundamentally special about orbits. Any object, were it able to pass
        through the ground like a ghost, would not stop upon reaching the centre of the earth. This would be a
        1-dimensional orbit, one with 'infinite' eccentricity. If it had a little bit of sideways momentum, like the
        cannonball, then it would carve out a veeeery eccentric but still 2-dimensional eliptical orbit. The more
        momentum, the less eccentric it would become. Eventually, given the exact right amount of momentum, it would be
        a perfect circle. Adding more would make it elliptical again but on a perpendicalar axis.</p>

    <p>Therefore, we do not so much as need to "achieve orbit" as achieve *an* orbit which *doesn't intersect the
        surface of the planet*. In the real-world, we also need to achieve a minimum altitude to avoid atmospheric drag
        slowing us down and de-orbiting, but in our simplified simulation we don't even need to worry about that.</p>

    <p>So, step 1 of getting to the moon is achieving a stable orbit. To do this, rather than pointing 'up', we need to
        point 'forward' in the direction we'd like to orbit, like the cannonball. This is called 'firing prograde'. Try
        it now!</p>

    <p>Congratulations, you have achieved orbit. Remember, you are still constantly falling. There is no way to stay
        still in space (well there is, but we'll get to that). So from now on, we're not so much moving the rocketship
        directly as we are changing our orbit. Spoiler alert, but we need to move to a higher altitude orbit if we're
        going to reach the moon. Have a go at trying to achieve such an orbit. What direction should we fire the rocket?
    </p>

    <p>It is intuitive to fire 'up', since we want to gain altitude. But remember, we didn't achieve orbit in the first
        place by firing up, because what goes up must come down. Indeed, you'll see that you gain altitude initially
        from this manouvre, but you fall right back down.</p>

    <p>Well done! Your logic is correct; if firing prograde is what got us into orbit, then surely we'd fire prograde to
        increase our altitude. The issue is, as you can see, whilst this has increased the peak altitude or apoapsis,
        one half orbit ahead of where we fired, it hasn't lifted the whole orbit. The minimum altitude, or peripasis,
        remains the same. Don't fret though; it turns out you can't achieve the desired higher altitude circular orbit
        with just one firing of the rocket (one 'burn'), but this burn was the necessary first step. What do you think
        is the second step?</p>

    <p>Ding ding ding! Your logic is correct again. If firing raises the altitude a half orbit ahead of where we are,
        then if we want to raise the periapsis to 'circularise' the orbit, we must do another prograde burn at the
        apoapsis. You now have the manouvre to raise your orbital altitude as much as you like. What if we want to lower
        the altitude? You should be able to figure this one out; what's the opposite of what we did before?</p>

    <p>Bingo! That's called a 'retro-grade' burn. One more a half orbit ahead and you'll circularise the orbit at the
        new lower altitude. Now, you have the power to orbit at any altitude you like! Lets test your skills.</p>

    <h2>Impulse Control</h2>
    <p>So far, you've been controlling the rocket by turning it on and off again. There hasn't been any way to control
        the throttle, so getting the right amount of force is a matter of timing the burn. This is actually realistic
        for how most rockets work! Only some special rockets have the ability to change the exhaust velocity. That's
        okay for normal missions though, because the amount of time spent burning is very, very small compared to the
        length of the mission itself, such that the rocketship effectively remains more or less in the same place for
        the duration of the burn.</p>


    <p>Ok, clearly you've got the hang of orbital manouvreing. Its time to bring back the Moon. Before we can land on
        the moon, we first need to get into orbit around it. This can be achieved with what you already know, we just
        need to put our apoapsis in the close vicinity of the moon, so that when we reach it we are 'captured' by its
        gravity. Have a go.</p>

    <p>Incredible! You're in lunar orbit. Now all we need to do is land. This, admittedly, is a bit more complex than
        just lowering your orbit. You essentially have to *launch* in reverse. That means firing retrograde until you
        have a collision trajectory, then firing 'up' in short bursts in order to slow your fall so that your landing
        velocity is almost zero.</p>

    <p>Absolutely brilliant, you've done it! Just for fun, I'll let you hop out and do a moon walk. When you're ready,
        hop back in the rocketship and see if you can use the same principles to get back home.</p>
